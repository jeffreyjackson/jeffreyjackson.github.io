{"name":"Jeffrey Jackson","tagline":"iOS / Mac Software Engineer","body":"### Jeffrey Jackson\r\nI am a small business owner, and an iOS / Mac software engineer available for hire.  \r\n\r\n### Previous Work\r\nI've been building software since 2001.  I started building Mac apps back in 2005, and then iOS a few years later when the SDK was first announced.  In 2009, I started [AutoLean, Inc.](http://www.autolean.com), a small software company that provides iOS/Mac, Android, and .NET development services for manufacturers and industrial oriented businesses.  AutoLean leverages mobile devices and lean manufacturing methodologies to increase productivity and safety, assist in problem solving, and manage assets in industrial settings.  \r\n\r\nAround late 2012 I started volunteering to help get [Over](http://www.madewithover.com) off the ground.  In 2013 I took a hiatus from everything else to work full time at Over as Founder and Engineer.  It's now one of the most popular apps for editing photos with great typography.  During my time there as Founder/Engineer, we built new rendering engines, an IAP store backend, and a few other popular apps like [Obaby & Obaby+](http://www.obabyapp.com), and [Overgram](http://www.overgram.co).  We were also able to team up with [Wild Measure](http://wildmeasure.com) to build and submit [Cape Town Love](http://www.thefreshexchangeblog.com/2013/09/announcing-an-app-in-a-day-with-over/) in less than 24 hours.  [Louisville Love](http://louisvilleloveapp.com) was another cool collaborative project we did with the very talented [Forest Giant](http://www.forestgiant.com).  While my time with Over was very rewarding as a software engineer, I made the decision to go back full-time with AutoLean in January 2014.  \r\n\r\nSome other side projects I've been involved with include: [Menu & Hours](http://www.menuandhours.com), and [JumpSeat](http://gojumpseat.com).  I also have experience with iOS applications in enterprise environments, specifically with private APIs, MDM, and OS X Server.  \r\n\r\nIn the coming months I plan on starting another christian based business, but one that provides software products and development services outside of my manufacturing client base.\r\n\r\n### Resume\r\nYou can get a copy of my resume [here](http://resume.jeffreyclarkejackson.com). \r\n\r\n### Get in Touch\r\nYou can find me either at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/_jeffreyjackson), [LinkedIn](http://lnkd.in/wYtSkV), or on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/jeffreyjackson).\r\n\r\n### Blog\r\nOn occasion, I'll post to this roon.io [blog](http://blog.jeffreyclarkejackson.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
