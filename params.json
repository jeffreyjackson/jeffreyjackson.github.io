{"name":"Jeffrey Jackson","tagline":"iOS / Mac Software Engineer","body":"### Jeffrey Jackson\r\nI am an iOS / Mac software engineer available for hire.  \r\n\r\n### Previous Work\r\nI've been building software since 2001.  I started building Mac apps back in 2005 when Apple went Intel, and  a few years later I got on board with the iOS SDK when it first came out.  In 2009, I started [AutoLean, Inc.](http://www.autolean.com), a small software company that provides iOS/Mac, Android, and .NET development services for manufacturers and industrial oriented businesses.  \r\n\r\nAround late 2012 I started volunteering to help get [Over](http://www.madewithover.com) off the ground.  In 2013 I took a hiatus from everything else to work full time at Over as Founder and Engineer. During this time, we built new rendering engines, a store backend, and a few other popular apps like [Obaby & Obaby+](http://www.obabyapp.com), and [Overgram](http://www.overgram.co).  We were also able to team up with [Wild Measure](http://wildmeasure.com) to build and submit [Cape Town Love](http://www.thefreshexchangeblog.com/2013/09/announcing-an-app-in-a-day-with-over/) in less than 24 hours.  [Louisville Love](http://louisvilleloveapp.com) was another cool collaborative project we did with the very talented [Forest Giant](http://www.forestgiant.com). \r\n\r\nSome other side projects I've been involved in include: [Menu & Hours](http://www.menuandhours.com), and [JumpSeat](http://gojumpseat.com).  In the coming months I plan on starting a new business for providing software products and development services outside of my manufacturing client base.\r\n\r\n### Resume\r\nYou can get a copy of my resume [here](http://resume.jeffreyclarkejackson.com).\r\n\r\n### Get in Touch\r\nYou can find me either at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/_jeffreyjackson), [LinkedIn](http://lnkd.in/wYtSkV), or on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/jeffreyjackson).\r\n\r\n### Blog\r\nOn occasion, I'll post to this roon.io [blog](http://blog.jeffreyclarkejackson.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
