<p>I've been building software since 2001.  I started building Mac apps back in 2005 when Apple went Intel, and  a few years later I got on board with the iOS SDK when it first came out.  In 2009, I started <a href="http://www.autolean.com">AutoLean, Inc.</a>, a small software company that provides iOS/Mac, Android, and .NET development services for manufacturers and industrial oriented businesses.  </p>

<p>Around late 2012 I started volunteering to help get <a href="http://www.madewithover.com">Over</a> off the ground.  In 2013 I took a hiatus from everything else to work full time at Over as Founder and Engineer. During this time, we built new rendering engines, a store backend, and a few other popular apps like <a href="http://www.obabyapp.com">Obaby &amp; Obaby+</a>, and <a href="http://www.overgram.co">Overgram</a>.  We were also able to team up with <a href="http://wildmeasure.com">Wild Measure</a> to build and submit <a href="http://www.thefreshexchangeblog.com/2013/09/announcing-an-app-in-a-day-with-over/">Cape Town Love</a> in less than 24 hours.  <a href="http://forestgiant.com/project/louisville-love-iphone-app">Louisville Love</a> was another cool collaborative project we did with the very talented <a href="http://www.forestgiant.com">Forest Giant</a>. </p>

<p>Some other side projects I've been involved in include: <a href="http://www.menuandhours.com">Menu &amp; Hours</a>, and <a href="http://gojumpseat.com">JumpSeat</a>.  In the coming months I plan on starting a new business for providing software products and development services outside of my manufacturing client base.</p>
